# ROBOFRIENDS
https://celagia.github.io/robofriends 
## This project was created as a way for me to learn React basics.

It simply grabs user data from an API and displays them as robots on separate cards.
There is also search functionality as well as smaller features such as a scrollable container and small animations.
